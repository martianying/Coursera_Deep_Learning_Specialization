## Notes
1. This is the 2nd assignment of week4. We use transfer learning to generate artistic images. **In addition to the Coursera videos**, this [CS230 in-class lecture on art generation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwQHqWyHRpU&t=48m33s) helps me a lot understand the algorithm (this lecture enlightens the thinking, though it does not include any details regarding how to calculate the <i>Style Loss</i> ).
2. **You might encounter an issue** getting an zero grade given by the grader though you have passed all tests in this assignment. Here are some possible sulutions to this provided by other learners on the [course disclosure](https://discourse.deeplearning.ai/t/course-4-assignment-submission-issues/3442/10).
