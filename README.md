# Coursera Deep Learning Specialization

## Credits
**I wrote all codes that are necessary for passing the assignments, others, unless specified otherwise, are all taken from <code>deeplearning.ai</code>.**


## What is this?
[Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=17-DeepLearning-US&utm_content=17-DeepLearning-US&campaignid=904733485&adgroupid=45435009112&device=c&keyword=online%20deep%20learning%20classes&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=415429156977&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=Cj0KCQjwsqmEBhDiARIsANV8H3YoWq1fu4SojIT8ZWJOGtco35miAQiJipnG0K3gUiJcXCwelTwERMgaAsE_EALw_wcB) is a series of 5 DL courses offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai) on Coursera. The instructor is [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org), who is great at explaining complicated concepts with an intuition approach. 

<br>
This specializtion consists of 5 courses: 

<br>Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
<br>Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization
<br>Course 3: Structruing Machine Learning Projects
<br>Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks
<br>Course 5: Sequence Models

This repository contains all the coding assignments in this specialization. But **NOTE** <code>deeplearning.ai</code> recently (April 2021) updated all their assignments to Tensorflow2.0, if you want to find assignments before the update, I highly recommand [amanchadha's solutions](https://github.com/amanchadha/coursera-deep-learning-specialization/blob/master/README.md).

## Others

**Download the workspace directly in Coursera (Recommanded)**
<br>If you want to download the entire coding assignment workspace to your local machine from coursera, you can follow the [Coursera's instructions on downloading workspace](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/360004990332-Download-Jupyter-Workspace-files).

**Use nbviwer**
<code>nbviewer</code> is a great tool to share jupyter notebooks with others, and also I find it very useful for reviewing or appreciating codes on the go. It basically renders notebooks to static websites that everyone can have access to it while keeping the original form of notebooks. To use it, [check out the nbviewer instructions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org). Note that, you might encounter a "404" situation, if that's the case, you might be suffering a delay. Check out the [solutions to delay in nbviewer](https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer/issues/938) to see if the proposed solution works for you (Sadly, it does not work for me :(, but patience works :P

**Helpful resources**
This specialization is sort of like a public version of <code>CS230</code> taught at Stanford. If you want to have a well-organized and tight schedule to follow or if you want to know more, I strongly recommand checking the [CS230 course website](https://cs230.stanford.edu/syllabus/) out.

**Hope this repo could be a reference for people who get stuck in these assignments, and also allow me to appreciate how beautifully the course developers had written all these codes at any time I want.**

<br>**Happy Learning!**
